# Discord Slack Bridge with Convex

Sync messages & threads from Discord into Slack.
It will turn Discord threads into Slack threads, replying in the right thread on
new messages.

My usecase is to mirror our "#support" forum in Discord into a Slack channel, so
folks here don't have to periodically switch from Slack to Discord to scan, and
which allows us to discuss and reference and search support threads in slack.

## Installation

### 1. Convex backend

To run it against your own backend:

```
npx convex init
npx convex deploy
```

To save the configuration in your repo, remove "convex.json" from .gitignore.
Copy the deployment URL for later (it should end with ".convex.cloud").

### 2. Configure Discord

1. Create a discord bot and authorize it, adding it to your server / guild.
2. Copy the token and save it in the environment variables in the dashboard
   with the key DISCORD_TOKEN. `npx convex dashboard` to get there.

### 3. Configure Slack

1. Create a slack app and install it into your workspace.
2. Copy the bot oauth token and save it in the convex environment variables as
   SLACK_TOKEN.

### 4. discordBot.js (on fly.io)

You can run the discordBot that connects to discord and sends changes to Convex
locally to test, then deploy it to fly.io.

**Locally:**

```
pnpm i
export DISCORD_TOKEN=<discord-token>
export CONVEX_URL=<deployment-URL>
npm run discordBot
```

**In Docker:**

```
npm run dockerBotBuild
npm run dockerBot
npm run clean && npm run build
```

**Deploy the discordBot.js to fly.io:**

1. Install flyctl, e.g. `brew install flyctl`
2. Deploy it the first time with `fly launch`, then `fly deploy` after.

3. Set the environment variables for it with:
   flyctl secrets set DISCORD_TOKEN=<discord-token>
   flyctl secrets set CONVEX_URL=<deployment-URL>

I just chose one instance in sjc, on the smallest (free) tier.
I did have to enter my CC info, but it hasn't been charged.

### 5. Mapping Discord channels to Slack

Once messages are coming in, you'll see the channels listed in the Convex
dashboard. You can edit a given channel and add `slackChannelId: "C0123456ABC"`
for your corresponding slack channel IDs. Then, new messages will get posted to
Slack, only for the Discord channels you want. Hooray!

## Backfill

You can backfill a discord channel by copying the channel ID and going to the
Convex dashboard, going to the "functions" section, and finding
actions / discord / backfillDiscordChannel .
Run it with a single parameter: `{ discordId: "1111111111111111111" }`
replacing the 1's with your discord ID.

Tip: In discord you can right-click various things and click "Copy ID"

I chose not to have this send these all to Slack, but instead just backfill into
the database. Doing it multiple times won't duplicate data, it won't overwrite
anything that already exists (unique on discord "id" field). If you wanted,
you could have it send the slack messages, but you'd probably want to make sure
you iterate over all the messages in order, so they're in order in Slack too.

For me, I just wanted the thread names and content to be in my DB for future
reference, e.g. to index it for search or train GPT.

## Debugging

- You can look at your discordBot.js logs in the fly.io dashboard under monitoring.
- You can see your convex functions in the convex dashboard under Logs
- You might run into issues where your bots need extra permissions and you need
  to re-install them into the workspace / guild to get the right oauth token.
- The discord bot doesn't catch updates to messages sent before it started
  up, but going forward, message updates / deletes should be sent along to slack.
  There's a `discord-logs` npm package that adds more events we could listen to
  in discordBot.js, maybe `unhandledMessageUpdate` would be useful?
  If you do that, send a PR please üôè.

## Search indexing

This repository also includes a cron job that ensures the appropriate discord
threads are indexed into Algolia for use in search. By default, this job
scans every minute for updated threads that may be eligible for indexing.

Don't worry! By default nothing is being indexed. But... what if you want
to start indexing in your installation? Here's how it's done:

1.  Add ALGOLIA_API_KEY to the deployment environment
2.  Set a boolean field called `indexForSearch` to `true` on any channel records
    that are appropriate. Typically this will just be the support forum channel.
3.  To reset the thread index scanning cursor, go into the `threadSearchStatus`
    table and update the `indexedCursor` number field to 0. This will ensure all
    threads get re-scanned for indexing eligibility

After that, any new or updated discord threads in the appopriate channel(s) will
be added to the Algolia index within a minute. If you ever change the document
structure, or for any other reason want to trigger a complete re-indexing of
Algolia, just repeat step (3) above and set the cursor back to zero.

## Extras

It has some code to handle slash commands, interactions, etc.
To do this, set the URL in slack to be
"https://<project-slug>.convex.site/slack/slash" for slash commands, or
"https://<project-slug>.convex.site/slack/interactivity" for interactions.
The slug is the part of the url in your deployment URL before `convex.cloud`.
E.g. https://happy-iguana-123.convex.site/slack/slash .
Notice the `.convex.site`! This is the http handlers, defined in convex/http.js.

Currently I have two shortcuts configured from slack: resolve & reply,
configured as "message" shortcuts. So you can right-click a message and send a
reply to Discord.

- For resolve, you'll need to update the code to pass the
  right Tag ID. For us, we have a tag in our support channel for "Resolved".
- For reply, you can add your `slackUserId: "U01234ABCDE",` in the `users`
  table. It won't reply as you, but it'll tag you in the reply.

Tip: you can get all your slack users & ids by running:

```
$ node

const token = <your slack token>;
const {WebClient} = require('@slack/web-api');
const web = new WebClient(token);
const users = await web.users.list();
users.members.map(m => `${m.real_name || m.name}: ${m.id}`)
```

There isn't bidirectional syncing - sending slack messages don't go to Discord.
They could, but we find it's better to chat in slack between coworkers, and
then go and message in Discord directly (which gets synced to slack).
